	The stability of the weakly ionized plasma and the transition from a stable homogeneous discharge to unstable filaments play an important role in gas laser physics, plasma-assisted combustion, chemical reforming, and material synthesis. Theoretical stability analysis and thermal-chemical mode analysis (TCMA) were performed to understand the mechanism of plasma thermal-chemical instability by using a zero-dimensional plasma system with both simplified and detailed chemical kinetics of H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures. The plasma dynamic and kinetic models accounted for multiple physical mechanisms in the chemically-reactive weakly ionized  plasma, including ionization, attachment/detachment, recombination, vibrational and electronic energy relaxation, convective and diffusive species/heat removal, Joule heating, and detailed chemical kinetics. An analytical criterion and the explosive mode species pointers (SP) were formulated while the representative active species (RAS) were identified for different thermal-chemical modes. The results showed that in addition to the classical thermal-ionization mechanism, various chemical modes from chemical heat imbalance and elementary kinetics significantly modified the time dynamics and the stability of the weakly ionized plasma. The present analysis provides insights and guidance to control plasma instability using chemical kinetics. </div></p>

	The multi-channel reaction of excited singlet oxygen atom with ethanol, O(<sup>1</sup>D) + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (1), was studied in a photolysis flow reactor coupled with mid-infrared Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) and UV-IR direct absorption spectroscopy (DAS) at 297 K with reactor pressures of 60, 120 and 150 Torr (bath He). The excited singlet oxygen atom was generated through the photolysis of O<sub>3</sub> at 266 nm. The photon flux and O(<sup>1</sup>D) concentrations were determined by <i>in situ</i> actinometry based on O<sub>3</sub> depletion. Temporal profiles of OH and H<sub>2</sub>O were monitored via DAS signals at <i>ca.</i> 3568.62 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 3568.29 cm<sup>-1</sup>, while temporal profiles of HO<sub>2</sub> were measured via FRS signals at <i>ca.</i> 1396.90 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The branching ratios of the target reaction (1) were determined by fitting temporal profiles to simulations from an in-house reaction mechanism. Two major reaction channels were identified as CH<sub>3</sub>CHOH + OH and CH<sub>3</sub>O + CH<sub>2</sub>OH, and their branching ratios were determined as 0.46 &plusmn 0.12 and 0.42 &plusmn 0.11, respectively. A specific HO<sub>2</sub> + RO<sub>2</sub> reaction between HO<sub>2</sub> and  O<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH (&#946-RO<sub>2</sub>) at the low temperature range is estimated in this work as HO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH -> products with a rate constant of 7 <span>&#215;</span> 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. </div></p>

	The present study investigates the kinetics of low-temperature pyrolysis and oxidation of n-dodecane/O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures in a repetitively-pulsed nanosecond discharge experimentally and numerically. Time-resolved TDLAS measurements, steady-state gas chromatography (GC) sampling, and mid-IR dual- modulation Faraday rotation spectrosocpy (DM-FRS) measurements are conducted to quantify temperature as well as species formation and evolution. A plasma-assisted n-dodecane pyrolysis and oxidation kinetic model incorporating the reactions involving electronically excited species and NO<sub>x</sub> chemistry is developed and validated. The results show that a nanosecond discharge can dramatically accelerate n-dodecane pyrolysis and oxidation at low temperatures. The numerical model has a good agreement with experimental data for the major intermediate species. From the pathway analysis, electronically excited N<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> plays an important role in n-dodecane pyrolysis and oxidation. The results also show that with addition of n-dodecane, NO concentration is reduced considerably, which suggests that there is a strong NO kinetic effect on plasma-assisted low-temperature combustion via NO-RO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>-fuel radical reaction pathways. This work advances the understandings of the kinetics of plasma-assisted low-temperature fuel oxidation in N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> mixtures. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">The control of plasma instability of weakly ionized plasma in a reactive flow is of great importance in plasma-assisted combustion, catalysis, fuel reforming and material synthesis. In this work, we propose a new concept of plasma chemical instability and analyze the mechanisms and impact of plasma chemical instability on the transition from a uniform discharge to a contracted state of a self-sustained glow discharge in a reactive H<sub>2</sub>–O<sub>2</sub>–N<sub>2</sub> mixture. A one-dimensional numerical model for plasma chemical instability was developed which accounted for convective heat loss, Joule heating of plasma, and major non-equilibrium plasma-assisted combustion kinetic pathways including electron-impact ionization, vibrational energy transfer, electron attachment, combustion reactions, and heat release. The results showed that plasma chemical instability significantly modified the onset plasma current of plasma thermal instability. Specifically, the critical condition of the instability transition was strongly influenced by electron-impact reactant ionization, electron attachment to oxygen, endothermic/exothermic chemical reactions, and the formation of reaction products. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) employs the Faraday effect to detect Zeeman splitting in the presence of a magnetic field. In this article, we present system design and implementation of radical sensing in a photolysis reactor using FRS. High sensitivity (100 ppb) and time resolved <i>in situ</i> HO<sub>2</sub> detection is enabled with a digitally balanced acquisition scheme. Specific advantages of employing FRS for sensing in such dynamic environments are examined and rigorously compared to the more established conventional laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS). Experimental results show that FRS enables HO<sub>2</sub> detection when LAS is deficient, and FRS compares favorably in terms of precision when LAS is applicable. The immunity of FRS to spectral interferences such as absorption of hydrocarbons and other diamagnetic species absorption and optical fringing are highlighted in comparison to LAS.</div></p>

    Abstract
    </button>
    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Layered nickel-rich materials are promising next-generation cathode materials for lithium ion batteries due to their high capacity and low cost. However, the poor thermal stability and longtime cycling performance hinders the commercial applications of high nickel materials. Doping with heteroatoms has been an effective approach for improving electrochemical performance of cathode materials. Controlling doping concentration and geometrical distribution is desired for optimal electrochemical performance, but it is challenging in traditional co-precipitation methods. In this work, controlled dysprosium (Dy) doping to NCM811 was studied in an aerosol synthesis method by controlling the precursor concentrations and heating parameters. The obtained materials were characterized by SEM, XRD, and XPS, and their electrochemical properties and thermal stability were evaluated. By controlling the doping concentration (1.5%), Dy-doped NCM811 was improved simultaneously in long-term cycling and high-rate performance. The thermal-chemical stability of the Dy-doped cathode materials was examined in a microflow reactor with a mass spectrometer. The results showed that Dy-doping shifted the O<sub>2</sub> onset temperature to a higher temperature and reduced O<sub>2</sub> release by 80%, thus dramatically increasing the thermal-chemical stability and improving the fire safety of cathode materials. Since high temperature aerosol synthesis is a low-cost and scalable method, the findings in this work have broad implications for commercial synthesis of novel materials with controlled doping modification to achieve high electrochemical performance and safety in lithium ion batteries. </div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Understanding the multi-channel dynamics of O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules in low temperature reaction kinetics is critically important in stratospheric chemistry, plasma chemistry, plasma assisted fuel reforming, materials synthesis, and plasma assisted combustion. A photolysis flow reactor coupled with highly selective mid-infrared Faraday Rotation Spectroscopy (FRS) and direct ultraviolet-infrared (UV-IR) absorption spectroscopy (DAS) techniques was developed for the first time to study the multi-channel dynamics of excited singlet oxygen atom O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactions with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and the kinetics of subsequent reactions. Time-resolved species concentrations of OH, HO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O were obtained and used to develop a validated kinetic model of O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactions with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. The branching ratios of O(<sup>1</sup>D) reaction with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and subsequent HO<sub>2</sub> kinetics were also quantified. It is found that, contrary to O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactions with saturated alkanes, OH formation via direct H abstraction by O(<sup>1</sup>D) is negligible. The results revealed that two chain-branching and propagation reactions via direct O(<sup>1</sup>D) insertion are the major pathways for radical production. The present study clearly demonstrated the advantage of radical detection and kinetic studies using FRS in the effective suppression of absorption interference from non-paramagnetic hydrocarbons. </div></p>

    </p>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">We demonstrate the use of laser-induced incandescence (LII) of submicron tungsten carbide (WC) particles as a method for particle image velocimetry (PIV). The technique allows a single laser to be used for separate measurements of velocity of two phases in a droplet-laden flow. Submicron WC particles are intentionally seeded into a two-phase flow, and heated by a light sheet generated by a double-pulsed PIV laser operating at sufficiently high pulse energy. The small size and large absorption cross section allows particles to be heated up to several thousand degrees Kelvin to emit strong incandescence signals, whilst the laser-induced temperature increase in liquid droplets/large particles is negligible. The incandescence signal from WC and Mie scattering from droplets/large particles are separately captured by deploying different filters to a PIV camera. The consecutive images of the laser-induced incandescence (LII) are used to determine the velocity field of the gas-phase flow, and those of Mie scatter are used to extract the velocity of droplets/large particles. The proposed technique is demonstrated in an air jet first and compared with the result given by a normal PIV test, which shows that submicron WC particles can accurately follow the gas flow, and that the LII images can be used to perform cross-correlations. We then apply this technique on an ethanol droplet/air jet (non-reacting), demonstrating the resulting slip velocity between two phases. The proposed technique combining PIV and LII with a single laser requires little additional equipment, and is applicable to a much higher droplet/particle density than previously feasible. Finally, the possibility of applying this technique to a flame is demonstrated and discussed. </div></p>
