    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Ammonia represents one of most promising zero-carbon energy solutions to address the increasingly urgent climate change problem. However, the existing utilization of ammonia faces significant challenges from low chemical reactivity and high NO<sub>x</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O emissions, which cause severe inefficiency issues such as cold start and cycle variability of power generation, and detrimental effects on air quality, respectively. A sustainable and energy-efficient approach to tackle the above challenges is low temperature plasma which enables non-equilibrium energy and chemical utilization of ammonia such as oxidation using renewable electricity. As such, this work, for the first time, explores plasma assisted ammonia oxidation at room temperature with a focus on unveiling non-equilibrium NO<sub>x</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O reaction pathways by combining <i>in situ</i> laser diagnostics with plasma modeling. We found that the non-equilibrium plasma controls the NO<sub>x</sub>  formation by supplying O/H/N atoms via electron-impact dissociation and collisional quenching of excited species. The N<sub>2</sub>O formation follows a two-step mechanism, where electron-impact reactions first provide amine radicals which further react with NO<sub>x</sub> to generate N<sub>2</sub>O. These pathways facilitate a high-efficiency and environment-friendly operation of plasma assisted ammonia oxidation with enhanced reactivity and reduced NO<sub>x</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O emissions through manipulating mixture compositions and plasma discharge parameters.</div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">  We investigate the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into CO and O<sub>2</sub> with nanosecond repetitively pulsed discharges (NRP) in a high-pressure batch reactor. Stable discharges are obtained at up to 12 bar. By-products are measured with gas chromatography. The energy efficiency is determined for a range of processing times, pulse energy, and fill pressures. It is only weakly sensitive to the plasma operating parameters, i.e., the extent of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion is almost linearly-dependent on the specific energy invested. A conversion rate as high as 14% is achieved with an energy efficiency of 23%. For long processing times, a saturation in the yield and a drop in efficiency are observed, due to the increasing role of three-body recombination reactions, as described by zero-dimensional detailed kinetic modeling. The modeling reveals the presence of three-stage kinetics between NRP pulses, controlled by electron-impact CO<sub>2</sub> dissociation, vibrational relaxation, and neutral elementary kinetics. Transport effects are shown to be important for CO<sub>2</sub> conversion at high pressures. For fill pressures beyond 10 bar, CO<sub>2</sub> may locally transit into supercritical states. The supercritical plasma kinetics may bypass atomic oxygen pathways and directly convert CO<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub>. This work provides a detailed analysis into plasma-based high-pressure CO<sub>2</sub> conversion, which is of great relevance to future large-scale sustainable carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).</div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">  This work computationally studies plasma assisted low temperature NH<sub>3</sub>/air ignition and NO<sub>x</sub> formation in a repetitively-pulsed nanosecond discharge at atmospheric pressure by using an experimentally-validated plasma-combustion kinetic model. The results show that plasma discharge significantly enhances low temperature NH<sub>3</sub> ignition. Compared with thermal ignition, the ignition delay time is shortened by 2-5 orders of magnitude due to the kinetic enhancement of excited species and radicals. The radicals (NH<sub>2</sub>, NH, H and O) produced through electron impact dissociation and quenching of electronically excited N<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>, O(<sup>1</sup>D) and N(<sup>2</sup>D) promote OH production and further accelerate NH<sub>3</sub> oxidation. The results show that there exists a non-monotonic dependence of ignition delay time on the reduced electric field strength. The optimum ignition enhancement is achieved at 250 Td at which the production of electronically excited species and radicals is most efficient. The vibrationally excited species produced at lower electric fields (&lt;100 Td) are less effective in enhancing ignition because they only induce gas heating through the fast vibrational-translational relaxation by NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. At a higher electric field, although the efficient production of NH<sub>2</sub>, NH, H, O and OH by plasma creates new low temperature reaction pathways in enhancing low temperature NH<sub>3</sub> ignition, the ignition is inhibited through NH + NO = N<sub>2</sub>O + H and chain-termination reaction NH<sub>2</sub> + HO<sub>2</sub> = NH<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>. The ignition delay times at different equivalence ratios show that the ignition enhancement by plasma is more effective at fuel-lean conditions due to the faster generation of N<sub>2</sub>(B), O(<sup>1</sup>D) and O from air, leading to accelerated NH<sub>3</sub> oxidation via O(<sup>1</sup>D) + NH<sub>3</sub> =  NH<sub>2</sub> + OH, NH<sub>3</sub> + O = NH<sub>2</sub> + OH and NH<sub>2</sub> + O = NH + OH. The sensitivity analysis shows that the reactions involving O and O(<sup>1</sup>D) production are more effective on NH<sub>3</sub> ignition enhancement than the fuel dissociation by electrons. Moreover, the ignition is also enhanced by NO<sub>x</sub> formation in plasma via reactions NH<sub>2</sub> + NO = NNH + OH and NO + HO<sub>2</sub> = NO<sub>2</sub> + OH. This work advances the understanding of non-equilibrium excitation and NOx formation by plasma discharge on low temperature NH<sub>3</sub> ignition.</div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Plasma stability in reactive mixtures is critical for various applications from plasma-assisted combustion to gas conversion. To generate stable and uniform plasmas and control the transition towards filamentation, the underlying physics and chemistry need a further look. This work investigates the plasma thermal-chemical instability triggered by dimethyl-ether (DME) low-temperature oxidation in a repetitive nanosecond pulsed dielectric barrier discharge. First, a plasma-combustion kinetic mechanism of DME/air is developed and validated using temperature and ignition delay time measurements in quasi-uniform plasmas. Then the multi-stage dynamics of thermal-chemical instability is experimentally explored: the DME/air discharge was initially uniform, then contracted to filaments, and finally became uniform again before ignition. By performing chemistry modeling and analyzing the local thermal balance, it is found that such nonlinear development of the thermal-chemical instability is controlled by the competition between plasma-enhanced low-temperature heat release and the increasing thermal diffusion at higher temperature. Further thermal-chemical mode analysis identifies the chemical origin of this instability as DME low-temperature chemistry. This work connects experiment measurements with theoretical analysis of plasma thermal-chemical instability and sheds light on future chemical control of the plasma uniformity.</div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Non-equilibrium plasmas derive their low temperature reactivity from producing and driving energetic electrons and active species under large electric fields. Therefore, the impact of reactants on the plasma properties including electron number density, electric field, and electron temperature is critical for applications such as plasma CH<sub>4</sub> reforming. Due to experimental complexity, electron properties and the electric field are rarely measured together in the same discharge. In this work, we combine time-resolved Thomson scattering and electric field induced second harmonic generation (EFISH) to probe electron temperature, electron density, and electric field strength in a 60 Torr CH<sub>4</sub>/Ar nanosecond-pulsed dielectric barrier discharge (ns-DBD) while varying the CH<sub>4</sub>  mole fraction from 0 to 8%. These measurements are compared to a 1-D numerical model to benchmark its predictions and identify areas of uncertainty. Nonlinear coupling between CH<sub>4</sub>  addition, electron temperature, electron density, and the electric field was directly observed. Contrary to previous measurements in He, the electron temperature increased with CH<sub>4</sub>  mole fraction. This rise in electron temperature is identified as electron heating by residual electric fields that increased with larger CH<sub>4</sub>  mole fraction. Moreover, the electron number density has been found to decrease rapidly with the increase of methane mole fraction. Comparison of these measurements with the model yielded better agreement at higher CH<sub>4</sub>  mole fractions and with the usage of ab initio calculated Ar electron-impact cross-sections from the B-spline R-matrix (BSR) database. Furthermore, the calculated plasma properties are shown to be sensitive to the residual surface charge implanted on the quartz dielectric surfaces. Without considering surface charge in the simulations, the calculated electric field profiles agreed well with the measurements, but the electron properties were underpredicted by more than a factor of three. Therefore, measurements of either the electric field or electron properties measurements alone are insuffcient to fully validate modelling predictions.</div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> This work numerically investigates the effects of non-equilibrium nanosecond plasma discharge pulse repetition frequency, pulse number, and flow velocity on the critical ignition volume, minimum ignition energy, and chemistry in a plasma-assisted H<sub>2</sub>/air flow at 300 K and 1 atm using a multi-scale adaptive reduced chemistry solver for plasma assisted combustion (MARCS-PAC). The interactions between discharges/ignition kernels spanning decoupled, partially-coupled and fully-coupled regimes in a pulse train are studied. For a single pulse discharge, increased flow velocity increases the minimum ignition energy required due to the increase of convective heat loss and flame stretch. The results show that the minimum ignition kernel propagation speed at the critical ignition kernel volume increases with the flow velocity. The minimum critical ignition volume decreases with the increase of plasma discharge energy. For sequential two-pulse discharges, ignition fails at both decoupled and partially-coupled regimes even when the total discharge energy is above the minimum ignition energy, but succeeds only in the fully-coupled regime at a shorter inter-pulse time. Overlap of the OH radical pool between the sequential two-pulse discharges and the increase of the chemistry effect due to the increase of reduced electric field in the fully-coupled regime contribute to the ignition enhancement. In addition, for two-pulse discharges in the fully-coupled discharge regime, the mixture can be ignited at a total energy below the minimum ignition energy of a single pulse with the same flow conditions. Moreover, for a given total discharge energy with multiple pulsed discharges, the enhancement of the ignition kernel volume has a non-monotonic dependence on discharge frequency and pulse number. The effective ignition enhancement can be achieved with an optimal pulse repetition frequency and pulse number. This work provides a new understanding of the mechanism for repetitive plasma ignition and insights for the optimization of plasma ignition in a reactive flow.</div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> In many low temperature plasmas (LTPs), the OH radical and temperature represent key properties of plasma reactivity. However, OH and temperature measurements in weakly ionized LTPs are often challenging, due to the low concentration and short lifetime of OH and alsoand the abrupt temperature rise caused by fast gas heating. To address such issue, this letter combined cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) with femtosecond (fs) pulses to enable sensitive single-shot broadband measurements of OH concentration and temperature with a time resolution of &#8764 180 nanoseconds (ns) in LTPs. Such combination leveraged several diagnostic benefits. With the appropriately designed cavity, an absorption gain of &#8764 66 was achieved, enhancing the actual OH detection limit by &#8764 55&#215 to the 10<sup>11</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> level (sub-ppm in this work) compared to single-pass absorption. Single-shot measurements were enabled while maintaining a time resolution of &#8764 180 ns sufficiently short for detecting OH with a lifetime of &#8764 100 &#956s. With the broadband fs laser, ~34000 cavity modes were matched with ~95 modes matched on each CCD pixel bandwidth, such that the fs-CEAS signal became highly immune to the laser-cavity coupling noise and considerably more robust across the entire spectral range. Also, the broadband fs laser allowed simultaneous sensing of many absorption features, which were exploited to enable simultaneous multi-parameter measurements with enhanced accuracies.</div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">This Letter reports a femtosecond ultraviolet laser absorption spectroscopy (fs-UV-LAS) for simultaneous <em>in situ</em> measurements of temperature and species. This fs-UV-LAS technique was demonstrated based on X<sup>2</sup>&#928-A<sup>2</sup>&#931<sup>+</sup> transitions of OH radicals near 308 nm generated in low temperature plasmas and flames. The fs-UV-LAS technique has revealed three major diagnostic benefits. First, a series of absorption features within a spectral bandwidth of &#8764 3.2 nm near 308nm were simultaneously measured and then enabled simultaneous multi-parameter measurements with enhanced accuracy. The results show that the temperature and OH concentration could be measured with accuracy enhanced by 29-88% and 58–91%, respectively, compared to those obtained with past two-narrow-line absorption methods. Second, an ultrafast time resolution of &#8764 120 picoseconds was accomplished for the measurements. Third, due to the large OH X<sup>2</sup>&#928-A<sup>2</sup>&#931<sup>+</sup> transitions in the UV range, a simple single-pass absorption with a 3-cm path length was allowed for measurements in plasmas with low OH number density down to &#8764 2 &#215 10<sup>13</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>. Also due to the large OH UV transitions, single-shot fs absorption measurements were accomplished in flames, which was expected to offer more insights into chemically reactive flow dynamics.</div>

This model is applied to simulate the impact of non-equilibrium plasma excitation and electrode geometry and heat loss on the dynamics of the discharge from streamer to spark and ignition kernel development in a H<sub>2</sub>/air mixture with a pair of cylindrical electrodes. The results show that the plasma-generated species (N<sub>2</sub>(A), N<sub>2</sub>(B), N<sub>2</sub>(a), N<sub>2</sub>(C), O(<sup>1</sup>D), O and H) in the spark and afterglow significantly accelerate the ignition kernel development. The increase of discharge voltage at the same total discharge energy promotes the non-equilibrium active species production. It is found that the production of electronically excited species at higher reduced electric field strength is more efficient in enhancing ignition in comparison to the vibrational excitation and heating. Moreover, the 2D simulation clearly reveals that the electric field and active species distribution are highly non-uniform. The streamers are initiated at the sharp outer edges of the negative and positive electrodes by a strong electric field while the electric field is much weaker at the centerline of the electrodes. Furthermore, the simulations reveal that the ignition enhancement is sensitive to the variation of electrode shape, diameter, and gap size due to the changes of electric field distribution and location of streamer formation. A cylindrical electrode produces a larger discharge volume and ignition kernel than the parabolic and spherical electrodes, when the discharge is localized near the axis of the gap. It is found that there is a non-monotonic dependence of ignition kernel size on the electrode diameter and inter-electrode distance. The increase of electrode diameter and gap size above the optimal conditions leads to the reduction of ignition kernel volume, due to the decrease of active species concentration and gas temperature. At a larger electrode surface area and electrode diameter as well as smaller electrode gap size, the heat loss to electrode plays a greater role in reducing the ignition kernel size and slowing ignition kernel development. This work provides insights and guidance to understand the kinetic enhancement of non-equilibrium plasma and the effects of electrode geometries on ignition for the optimization ignitors in advanced engines.</div></p>

	The stability of the weakly ionized plasma and the transition from a stable homogeneous discharge to unstable filaments play an important role in gas laser physics, plasma-assisted combustion, chemical reforming, and material synthesis. Theoretical stability analysis and thermal-chemical mode analysis (TCMA) were performed to understand the mechanism of plasma thermal-chemical instability by using a zero-dimensional plasma system with both simplified and detailed chemical kinetics of H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures. The plasma dynamic and kinetic models accounted for multiple physical mechanisms in the chemically-reactive weakly ionized  plasma, including ionization, attachment/detachment, recombination, vibrational and electronic energy relaxation, convective and diffusive species/heat removal, Joule heating, and detailed chemical kinetics. An analytical criterion and the explosive mode species pointers (SP) were formulated while the representative active species (RAS) were identified for different thermal-chemical modes. The results showed that in addition to the classical thermal-ionization mechanism, various chemical modes from chemical heat imbalance and elementary kinetics significantly modified the time dynamics and the stability of the weakly ionized plasma. The present analysis provides insights and guidance to control plasma instability using chemical kinetics. </div></p>

	The multi-channel reaction of excited singlet oxygen atom with ethanol, O(<sup>1</sup>D) + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (1), was studied in a photolysis flow reactor coupled with mid-infrared Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) and UV-IR direct absorption spectroscopy (DAS) at 297 K with reactor pressures of 60, 120 and 150 Torr (bath He). The excited singlet oxygen atom was generated through the photolysis of O<sub>3</sub> at 266 nm. The photon flux and O(<sup>1</sup>D) concentrations were determined by <i>in situ</i> actinometry based on O<sub>3</sub> depletion. Temporal profiles of OH and H<sub>2</sub>O were monitored via DAS signals at <i>ca.</i> 3568.62 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 3568.29 cm<sup>-1</sup>, while temporal profiles of HO<sub>2</sub> were measured via FRS signals at <i>ca.</i> 1396.90 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The branching ratios of the target reaction (1) were determined by fitting temporal profiles to simulations from an in-house reaction mechanism. Two major reaction channels were identified as CH<sub>3</sub>CHOH + OH and CH<sub>3</sub>O + CH<sub>2</sub>OH, and their branching ratios were determined as 0.46 &plusmn 0.12 and 0.42 &plusmn 0.11, respectively. A specific HO<sub>2</sub> + RO<sub>2</sub> reaction between HO<sub>2</sub> and  O<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH (&#946-RO<sub>2</sub>) at the low temperature range is estimated in this work as HO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH -> products with a rate constant of 7 <span>&#215;</span> 10<sup>-12</sup> cm<sup>3</sup> molecule<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. </div></p>

	The present study investigates the kinetics of low-temperature pyrolysis and oxidation of n-dodecane/O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> mixtures in a repetitively-pulsed nanosecond discharge experimentally and numerically. Time-resolved TDLAS measurements, steady-state gas chromatography (GC) sampling, and mid-IR dual- modulation Faraday rotation spectrosocpy (DM-FRS) measurements are conducted to quantify temperature as well as species formation and evolution. A plasma-assisted n-dodecane pyrolysis and oxidation kinetic model incorporating the reactions involving electronically excited species and NO<sub>x</sub> chemistry is developed and validated. The results show that a nanosecond discharge can dramatically accelerate n-dodecane pyrolysis and oxidation at low temperatures. The numerical model has a good agreement with experimental data for the major intermediate species. From the pathway analysis, electronically excited N<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup> plays an important role in n-dodecane pyrolysis and oxidation. The results also show that with addition of n-dodecane, NO concentration is reduced considerably, which suggests that there is a strong NO kinetic effect on plasma-assisted low-temperature combustion via NO-RO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>-fuel radical reaction pathways. This work advances the understandings of the kinetics of plasma-assisted low-temperature fuel oxidation in N<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> mixtures. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Faraday rotation spectroscopy (FRS) employs the Faraday effect to detect Zeeman splitting in the presence of a magnetic field. In this article, we present system design and implementation of radical sensing in a photolysis reactor using FRS. High sensitivity (100 ppb) and time resolved <i>in situ</i> HO<sub>2</sub> detection is enabled with a digitally balanced acquisition scheme. Specific advantages of employing FRS for sensing in such dynamic environments are examined and rigorously compared to the more established conventional laser absorption spectroscopy (LAS). Experimental results show that FRS enables HO<sub>2</sub> detection when LAS is deficient, and FRS compares favorably in terms of precision when LAS is applicable. The immunity of FRS to spectral interferences such as absorption of hydrocarbons and other diamagnetic species absorption and optical fringing are highlighted in comparison to LAS.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Layered nickel-rich materials are promising next-generation cathode materials for lithium ion batteries due to their high capacity and low cost. However, the poor thermal stability and longtime cycling performance hinders the commercial applications of high nickel materials. Doping with heteroatoms has been an effective approach for improving electrochemical performance of cathode materials. Controlling doping concentration and geometrical distribution is desired for optimal electrochemical performance, but it is challenging in traditional co-precipitation methods. In this work, controlled dysprosium (Dy) doping to NCM811 was studied in an aerosol synthesis method by controlling the precursor concentrations and heating parameters. The obtained materials were characterized by SEM, XRD, and XPS, and their electrochemical properties and thermal stability were evaluated. By controlling the doping concentration (1.5%), Dy-doped NCM811 was improved simultaneously in long-term cycling and high-rate performance. The thermal-chemical stability of the Dy-doped cathode materials was examined in a microflow reactor with a mass spectrometer. The results showed that Dy-doping shifted the O<sub>2</sub> onset temperature to a higher temperature and reduced O<sub>2</sub> release by 80%, thus dramatically increasing the thermal-chemical stability and improving the fire safety of cathode materials. Since high temperature aerosol synthesis is a low-cost and scalable method, the findings in this work have broad implications for commercial synthesis of novel materials with controlled doping modification to achieve high electrochemical performance and safety in lithium ion batteries. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">Understanding the multi-channel dynamics of O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules in low temperature reaction kinetics is critically important in stratospheric chemistry, plasma chemistry, plasma assisted fuel reforming, materials synthesis, and plasma assisted combustion. A photolysis flow reactor coupled with highly selective mid-infrared Faraday Rotation Spectroscopy (FRS) and direct ultraviolet-infrared (UV-IR) absorption spectroscopy (DAS) techniques was developed for the first time to study the multi-channel dynamics of excited singlet oxygen atom O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactions with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and the kinetics of subsequent reactions. Time-resolved species concentrations of OH, HO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O were obtained and used to develop a validated kinetic model of O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactions with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. The branching ratios of O(<sup>1</sup>D) reaction with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and subsequent HO<sub>2</sub> kinetics were also quantified. It is found that, contrary to O(<sup>1</sup>D) reactions with saturated alkanes, OH formation via direct H abstraction by O(<sup>1</sup>D) is negligible. The results revealed that two chain-branching and propagation reactions via direct O(<sup>1</sup>D) insertion are the major pathways for radical production. The present study clearly demonstrated the advantage of radical detection and kinetic studies using FRS in the effective suppression of absorption interference from non-paramagnetic hydrocarbons. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">The control of plasma instability of weakly ionized plasma in a reactive flow is of great importance in plasma-assisted combustion, catalysis, fuel reforming and material synthesis. In this work, we propose a new concept of plasma chemical instability and analyze the mechanisms and impact of plasma chemical instability on the transition from a uniform discharge to a contracted state of a self-sustained glow discharge in a reactive H<sub>2</sub>–O<sub>2</sub>–N<sub>2</sub> mixture. A one-dimensional numerical model for plasma chemical instability was developed which accounted for convective heat loss, Joule heating of plasma, and major non-equilibrium plasma-assisted combustion kinetic pathways including electron-impact ionization, vibrational energy transfer, electron attachment, combustion reactions, and heat release. The results showed that plasma chemical instability significantly modified the onset plasma current of plasma thermal instability. Specifically, the critical condition of the instability transition was strongly influenced by electron-impact reactant ionization, electron attachment to oxygen, endothermic/exothermic chemical reactions, and the formation of reaction products. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;">We demonstrate the use of laser-induced incandescence (LII) of submicron tungsten carbide (WC) particles as a method for particle image velocimetry (PIV). The technique allows a single laser to be used for separate measurements of velocity of two phases in a droplet-laden flow. Submicron WC particles are intentionally seeded into a two-phase flow, and heated by a light sheet generated by a double-pulsed PIV laser operating at sufficiently high pulse energy. The small size and large absorption cross section allows particles to be heated up to several thousand degrees Kelvin to emit strong incandescence signals, whilst the laser-induced temperature increase in liquid droplets/large particles is negligible. The incandescence signal from WC and Mie scattering from droplets/large particles are separately captured by deploying different filters to a PIV camera. The consecutive images of the laser-induced incandescence (LII) are used to determine the velocity field of the gas-phase flow, and those of Mie scatter are used to extract the velocity of droplets/large particles. The proposed technique is demonstrated in an air jet first and compared with the result given by a normal PIV test, which shows that submicron WC particles can accurately follow the gas flow, and that the LII images can be used to perform cross-correlations. We then apply this technique on an ethanol droplet/air jet (non-reacting), demonstrating the resulting slip velocity between two phases. The proposed technique combining PIV and LII with a single laser requires little additional equipment, and is applicable to a much higher droplet/particle density than previously feasible. Finally, the possibility of applying this technique to a flame is demonstrated and discussed. </div></p>
